# Hydrogeology database
This part of the website is used to create an orderly database where information is not repeated and is not lost as new wells or points are added. The database module includes pumping wells, monitoring wells, environmental wells, test pits, geotechnical wells, flow measurements, weather stations, etc. All of this types of points are assigned to a zone in the conceptual model. Each of these points can have level, chemical or flow information that change over time.
